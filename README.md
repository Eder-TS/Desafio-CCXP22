This project was created using a Figma model. First de HTML was created dividing the model into areas to be manipulated with CSS.<br>
Then the style properties were applied to achieve the model and to improve responsiveness with different screens.<br>
Having done this, was developed a function on Javascript to execute the countdown.<br>
